This is a basic AngularJS app

This uses the ng-route functionality and as such requiers a server to be able to run. I used the http-server from NPM.

As this is such a small app, I didn't spend too much time on formating the files. The only folder is a templates folder where the html templates that get pulled in to the SPA. 
The config.js file has the controlers and all the Javascript for this app. I usually put each of the controllers in seperate files but that seemed excessive for this app.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
